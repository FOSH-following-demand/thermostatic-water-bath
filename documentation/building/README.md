### 1. __Getting started__

#_How to upload the code to the arduino?_
  First, after downloading the arduino IDE for different [plataforms](https://www.arduino.cc/) and Configuring it as is showned [here](https://github.com/FOSH-following-demand/thermostatic-water-bath/tree/master/software/MCU) we need to upload the code.

  After cloning or downloading all the package, you'll download the last version of the code on the __/master/software/MCU__ directory (_actually is 0.0.2_).

  Now, you will open the arduino IDE, and an empty sketch will be loaded

  __To load a program__ you need to open the file called _0.0.2_ (the last version of the software)

  Click __Open__

  Once the program is loaded, you'll need to verify it using the Check button :heavy_check_mark: .

  if everything is correct, and the arduino is correcly connected based on the schematics, you can upload the code using the right arrow :arrow_right:

  __WARNING:__  Make sure than you selected the correct _microcontroller_ in the selection menu, as showned here

  After that, you'll see the current temperature in the monitor of the Arduino Serial Monitor (you can use _crtl + shift + m_ as direct access) as showned on the end of the video.
