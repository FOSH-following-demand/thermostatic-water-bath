#### Code of conduct


# We welcome and support people of all backgrounds and identities.

This includes, but is not limited to members of any sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, social and economic class, educational level, color, immigration status, sex, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.

# We won't all agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for disrespectful behavior.

We will all experience frustration from time to time, but we cannot allow that frustration become personal attacks.

# We can find strength in diversity.

Different people have different perspectives on issues, and that can be valuable for solving problems or generating new ideas.

Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong.

# Don’t forget that we all make mistakes, and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere.

Instead, focus on resolving issues, putting commits on this repository and learn from mistakes.
