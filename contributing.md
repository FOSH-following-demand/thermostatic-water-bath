It has taken a lot of work, hours of practice with the team, designs, joys, software bugs, design problems and much effort to move forward, be patient that if we have something extraordinary, we will put it immediately in the repository.

## Things to consider [28/08/19]

- current we are working in the "cold process" and the __Arduino code__ of the peltier module, the goal is to cool down 1 L of distilled water to a temperature of (=ambient - 17Â°C ) in an isolated environment.
- we don't have a final box to all the construction, but the main things to consider are:
  * must have the 1L capacity, with an overshooting of 500ml in case of an overflow of destilled water.
  * We are thinking of using commercial expandable polyurethane foam, to create an optimal environment for thermal insulation.
  * We do not want to use any type of expanded polystyrene for insulation, since it is very toxic and is not suitable for this project.

## These is a list of things you can do in order to contribute to the project:
